Ms Poh's lessons are never boring
especially when she draws maps
the whole class would laugh 
but she knows what we are thinking
Ariel always tries to be a good history rap
and tries to answers her questions
but to no avail as Regina or Josh would answer it
conclusion is that she is kind and funny
HAPPY TEACHERS DAY!
